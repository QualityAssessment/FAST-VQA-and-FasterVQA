# Pretrained Weights

From version >=0.6.1, we supported automatic downloading of model weights while embedding the FAST-VQA into your scripts like ```from fastvqa import deep_end_to_end_vqa; deep_end_to_end_vqa(True)```.

Still, we provide the temporary download link for the two following weights.
